### Predicting dry body masses in (geometrid) moths

This is the repository of the paper *Predicting insect body masses based on linear measurements: a phylogenetic case study on geometrid moths.* The paper can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blad069). 

The repository contains the web app implementing the methods of Foerstert et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blad069)) to predict dry body masses (at the adult emergence) in lepidopterans, especially in geometrid moths.

**Note**: a new and much more complete web app to predict several life-history traits in insects (and other invertebrates) is being currently developed and will soon be released in a further publication.

This project is funded by the Estonian Research Council (grant PRG741).
